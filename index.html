        <h2>The office is designed to be calming and relaxing</h2>
        <p>The purpose of the design of this dental office was to create a space that would make every patient feel comfortable, relaxed, and at ease. The use of natural light helps to illuminate the large windows along one wall which allows for plenty of sunlight during the day. This natural light also provides a more even lighting throughout the entire room keeping it less harsh on patients’ eyes when they are in various stages of treatment including exams, x-rays, or taking care of their teeth. Along with this, there are many different types of chairs in each area so that everyone will have an available chair no matter what size they may be or what type they need for any procedure being done on them or just waiting around for an appointment.</p>
        <p>The waiting room is designed with a cozy seating area for families and friends to sit in during the time they are waiting on a patient or their loved one. There is a TV that hangs above a fireplace that allows patients to relax and keep themselves entertained while they wait. The treatment areas also contain chairs that offer support for patients who need it, especially after procedures when comfort may be needed before they head home. This dental office has many different chairs for each type of situation so everyone should be able to feel comfortable no matter what needs to be done on them while they are there at Comfort Dental Providence RI.</p>
